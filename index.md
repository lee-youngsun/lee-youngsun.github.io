I am a PhD student in Education Policy at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on the inequity that students face in American public schools: (1) the causes of racial/ethnic disproportionality in school discipline, (2) socioeconomic disparities among Asian students, and (3) teachers' stereotypes and systematic barriers faced by racially/ethnically marginalized students. I use quantitative and qualitative methods to deepen the understanding, causal inference modeling and document analysis and literature review with a qualitative lens.
  - School Discipline
  - Socioeconomic Inequality
  - Asian Students
  - Descriptive/Causal analysis

I had worked at the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training (KRIVET), where I coordinated two national projects for career education. With teaching experiences ranging from elementary to undergraduate, I enjoy engaging with students, and facilitating their growth in both academically and personally. I am open to collaboration; discussions with educators and researchers about improving our school community are my favorite.
