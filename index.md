I am a PhD student in Education Policy at the University of Maryland, College Park. My research focuses on the inequities in American public schools and teachers' stereotypes and systematic barriers faced by racially/ethnically marginalized students. 
  - School Discipline
  - Socioeconomic Inequality
  - Asian Students
  - Descriptive/Causal analysis

I had worked at the Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training (KRIVET), where I coordinated two national projects for career education. With teaching experiences ranging from elementary to undergraduate, I enjoy engaging with students, and facilitating their growth in both academically and personally. I am open to collaboration; discussions with educators and researchers about improving our school community are my favorite.
